# OSI Model and TCP/IP

- What is the OSI model
- What is the Longform of OSI model
    -  Open systems Interconnection model
- How may layers in the OSI Model. 

- What is the TCP/IP model
    - is contain 5 layers instead of 7 layers as in OCI model. Here , application, presentation, and session layers are merged in Application layer. Rest all the other are similar to OCI Layer.

- What models of OCI are combined in real world TCP/IP protocols
- What are functions of Application layer in OCI
    - itâ€™s mainly implemented in Applications.
- What are the functions of Prsentation layer in OCI
    - This layer is responsible for the formats in which the data is made of. (Txt, jpg, mp4, etc) compresses the data and translates to machine language using encoding and by providing abstraction using ssl protocols.
- What is the function of session layer in OCI
    - this is responsible for setting up and managing of the connected sessions.
- What is the function of Transport layer
    - this is responsible for sending the above received data to the destination by dividing into segments(Contains port numbers and sequence number to reassemble the data, flow control and error control using checksum)utilises TCP or UDP Protocols.
- What are the functions of Network layer
    - this works for transmission of received data segments from one PC to another which is located in different network. *This is where the Router is located.* This assigns the illusion address of sender and receiver and forms an IP packet( so the data reaches the correct destination). Logical addressing.
- What are the functions of Data Link Layer
    - This receives the data from network layer and adds MAC address of sender and receiver to forms Frame.
- What are the functions of Physical layer
    - This contain all the hardware required for converting the above data to machine language and sends the signal of cable/wireless.
