# What is lifecycle management?

Lifecycle management includes the configuration and currency of the cloud environment's core processes, services, operations, and support components. Private cloud technologies have short release cycles that make it challenging for enterprises to stay current.

The need to stay current requires that cloud delivery teams adopt development practices such as automated testing, continuous integration, and infrastructure-as-code practices. You can no longer manage general upgrades and patches as major projects.
